      <h2>🌱 My Cabbage Patch Adoption Story</h2>
      <p>
        One of the greatest joys of my childhood was going to <strong>Toys “R” Us</strong> and
        adopting the perfect Cabbage Patch Kid — the one I felt fit me personally. I still
        remember the excitement, the adoption certificate, and how special it felt to choose
        a doll that seemed to be made just for me.

      <h2>📜 Who Was Xavier Roberts?</h2>
      <div class="timeline">
        <p>
          In the late 1970s, artist <strong>Xavier Roberts</strong> began creating soft sculptured
          dolls in his hometown of <strong>Cleveland, Georgia</strong>. His creations were inspired
          by a desire to make unique, adoptable dolls that felt alive with personality.
        </p>
        <p>
          By 1982, thanks to partnerships and careful marketing, these dolls became known as
          <strong>Cabbage Patch Kids</strong>, rapidly becoming a massive cultural phenomenon through
          the 1980s.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike most dolls of the era, Cabbage Patch Kids came with their own names and
          adoption papers — something that made each one feel truly special and one-of-a-kind.
          <section class="certificate">
  <h2>Official Adoption Certificate</h2>

    This certifies that a very special
    <strong>Cabbage Patch Kid</strong>
    has found a loving home.
  </p>

  <p>
    Adopted with love from <strong>Toys “R” Us</strong>
    during the unforgettable 1980s.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each Cabbage Patch Kid is unique,
    with their own name, personality,
    and place in our hearts.

    <!-- Georgia Origin Section -->
    <section>
      <h2>🌾 Origin in Georgia</h2>
      <p>
        The heart of the Cabbage Patch story lives in <strong>Cleveland, Georgia</strong>, a small
        town tucked into the Appalachian foothills. This is where Xavier Roberts first began
        hand-crafting his dolls, quickly growing from a local sensation into an international craze.
      </p>
      <p>
        Families from all over the country — including me — remember lining up at stores to “adopt”
        their favorite Cabbage Patch Kid during the high-demand 1980s toy seasons.

      <h2>👶 Cabbage Patch “Hospital” in Cleveland, Georgia</h2>
      <p>
        Even today, visitors can experience the magic firsthand at the <strong>Cabbage Patch Kids
        Hospital</strong> in Cleveland, Georgia — where dolls are “born” and can be adopted
        just like in the stories. It's a living link to that nostalgic world of imagination and
        wonder that made these dolls so beloved.
      </p>
      <p>
        From watching dolls being “born” to taking home your own Cabbage Patch Kid, it’s a place
        that keeps the heart of the original phenomenon alive.
